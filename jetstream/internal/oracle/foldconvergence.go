// CheckFoldConvergence is the §R7 eventually-consistent correctness invariant
// that replaced the point-in-time CheckOverlayReconstruction (which encoded the
// client-side suppression behavior deleted in steps 2/4 of the
// drop-client-tombstones refactor).
//
// The contract under test is no longer "the client emits exactly the live set."
// Backfill is now AT-LEAST-ONCE: the client may emit transient stale rows (a
// create it downloaded that a later delete supersedes), and a FOLDING consumer
// converges to network truth. So we assert convergence, not point-in-time
// equality:
//
//	Fold the FULL emitted stream (create/update apply; delete/account-delete/
//	sync remove) in seq order with the same rules as groundTruthLive, then
//	restrict the OUTPUT record set by the query's collection filter. The result
//	must equal an INDEPENDENT ground truth (groundTruthLive over the full
//	observed stream) restricted by the same collection filter.
//
// Two properties this encodes precisely (both are §R7 requirements):
//
//   - Killers match by DID, not collection. A DID-level tombstone
//     (account-delete / sync) carries an EMPTY collection, so it can never be
//     matched to a victim record by collection. groundTruthLive already folds
//     them by DID; the OUTPUT restriction is applied AFTER the fold, so a
//     DID-level killer in the stream still purges a collection-filtered record.
//
//   - It is sensitive to the §R3 gap. A collection-filtered backfill that
//     downloads an in-scope create C but never receives C's DID-level killer D
//     (because D carries an empty collection and rides in no collection block,
//     and sits below the live tip) folds to C-PRESENT while ground truth has C
//     PURGED — so this check DIVERGES. That divergence is exactly what the
//     shipped fix closes: the DID-marker sentinel index (segment/sentinel.go;
//     the planner unions sentinel collection ids in
//     manifest.collectionIDsForSegment) tags marker-bearing blocks with
//     $account/$identity/$sync so a collection-filtered plan selects them and D
//     rides inline. (An earlier design used a client-side DID-tombstone
//     start-snapshot here; that was reverted in favor of the sentinel index —
//     see foldconvergence_gate_test.go and design §R4 REVISED.)
//
// emitted is the client's complete emitted stream for the query (the OBSERVED
// side). full is the complete, independently-observed event stream for the
// whole server (the GROUND-TRUTH side — e.g. a direct segment scan), used to
// derive network truth WITHOUT consulting the filtered output. collections is
// the query's collection filter (nil/empty = no collection restriction, i.e.
// the whole stream). DO NOT pass the filtered stream as `full`: cross-checking
// filtered-vs-filtered on the same server is blind to the gap (§R7).
