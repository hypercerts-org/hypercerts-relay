// assertChainDurable is the post-restart assertion bundle for the durable
// intermediates a chainCoordinator injected. It runs three independent
// checks over the recovered on-disk segments (plan §4):
//
//  1. at-least-once event-log coverage (§4.2): every model-derived chain
//     row that should be durable appears on disk at least once, after
//     subtracting the creates compaction legitimately removed at W;
//  2. compaction contract (§4.3): no superseded create/update survives
//     at or below W (CheckCompacted);
//  3. record-level no-permanent-tombstone (§4.3): for the delete→recreate
//     shape, the recreated record reconstructs as present.
//
// The expected side is model-derived (the ops the coordinator issued), so
// it is independent of the system under test; seqs come from the disk rows
// only as a join coordinate for the watermark filter.
// chainCoverageView is the computed coverage comparison for a recovered
// run: the model-derived expected durable rows (filtered at W) and the
// observed on-disk rows, both seq-zeroed for key-based comparison. It is
// shared by the positive assertion (assertChainDurable) and the per-shape
// red-first power tests, so both compare against the identical sets.
