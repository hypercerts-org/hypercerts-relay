// CompactedFailureVerdict classifies WHY the client-backfill serving path
// tripped CheckCompacted, by re-running the identical contract check against
// the on-disk segments at the same watermark.
//
// The served (client-backfill) stream and the on-disk segments are two
// independent observation surfaces of the same compaction contract
// (docs/README.md §3.3). The served surface is the paginated client backfill —
// planSnapshot -> getSegment/getBlock -> live-subscribe cutover — that real
// clients use (this replaced the bespoke whole-archive /subscribe?cursor=0
// replay; see specs/oracle.md "Client-Driven Historical Tier"). When that
// surface reports a superseded survivor, the on-disk surface tells us which
// side is actually wrong:
//
//   - on-disk ALSO violates  -> Jetstream physically persisted a superseded
//     row: a durable storage/compaction defect (highest severity).
//   - on-disk is CLEAN       -> the bytes are correct; the violation is a
//     serving-path artifact, e.g. a cold-batch handoff across the paginated
//     getSegment/getBlock download mixing a pre-compaction prefix with a
//     post-compaction suffix. This points at the serving/transport path, not a
//     storage bug.
//
// A clean on-disk result is only trustworthy when no compaction pass mutated
// the segment directory during the scan: a rename mid-scan can hide or
// fabricate rows, so a clean-but-raced scan is reported INCONCLUSIVE rather
// than SERVING. A disk VIOLATION, by contrast, is durable regardless of a
// racing pass, because a pass can only remove rows (segment.Rewrite is
// strictly subtractive), so a surviving superseded row is real.

// ClassifyCompactedFailure bisects a client-backfill CheckCompacted failure.
// servedErr MUST be the non-nil error returned by CheckCompacted over the
// client-backfill serving stream; disk is the on-disk segment stream observed
// at the same watermark; passesDuringScan is the number of compaction passes
// that completed while the on-disk scan ran (0 means the scan was not raced).
//
// PRECONDITION on watermark capture: watermark MUST be captured no later than
// the scan's first segment read. The DURABLE verdict's soundness under a race
// rests on it. The compactor commits a chunk's rewrites to disk before it
// advances the committed watermark (orchestrator applyCompactionChunk then
// saveCompactionWatermark), so "watermark >= S" implies the rewrite that drops
// S already renamed into place. With watermark captured first, a survivor at
// seq S <= watermark seen on disk therefore provably persisted past its
// compaction deadline -> a real durable defect, and a later racing pass can
// only drop more rows, never resurrect S. If a caller instead captured the
// watermark AFTER the scan, a row legitimately present at the read-time
// watermark but dropped by a pass that then advanced the watermark past S
// could be mislabeled DURABLE_DEFECT -- so don't.
//
// It panics if servedErr is nil: the bisection is only meaningful after the
// served check has already failed, and a nil error would yield a misleadingly
// clean verdict.
