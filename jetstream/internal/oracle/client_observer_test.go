// client is an OBSERVATION SURFACE ONLY — expected state is still derived
// independently from simulator world + firehose history, never from the client
// itself.
//
// It drains the client's full emitted stream — archive AND live tail — until
// the reconstructed final state converges to the independently-derived ground
// truth (converged returns true on a clean Compare), or the deadline fires.
// Draining to convergence is the load-bearing stop condition under the relaxed
// eventually-consistent contract (drop-client-tombstones §R1/§R7): backfill is
// AT-LEAST-ONCE, so the client may emit a create that a later delete supersedes
// (no client-side suppression remains). A per-seq completeness check over any
// fixed window is therefore unsound — transient stale rows are expected. Final
// state, by contrast, is key-based and seq-space-agnostic: Reconstruct folds the
// full emitted stream and it is comparable exactly when the client has caught up
// to the quiescent world, which is what convergence detects. This Reconstruct +
// Compare-to-convergence over the UNFILTERED stream IS the fold-convergence
// invariant (CheckFoldConvergence) for the no-collection-filter query.
//
// The live tail never ends on its own; convergence (or the deadline) is the
// stop condition. Recoverable client errors are COUNTED (not silently
// swallowed) so the caller can assert them against the run's fault budget; a
// client-path error is never expected on a no-fault run.

//     derived independently from the simulator MST. This is the load-bearing
//     correctness check: it is key-based (DID/collection/rkey/payload) and so

//     DIDs/collections, serves a stale payload, or emits an extra row. The
//     drain runs to CONVERGENCE on this Compare (see collectClientBackfill):
//     the world is quiescent at this point in the lifecycle, so a correct
//     client converges and a defective one never does (fails at the deadline
//     with the precise Compare mismatch).
//
//  2. COMPACTION CONTRACT: CheckCompacted over the client's (-inf, watermark]
//     window — no create/update row superseded by a tombstone at or below the
//     watermark survives. On failure, #94's disk-vs-serving bisection
//     classifies it as a durable defect vs. a serving/client artifact.
//
//  3. ERROR BUDGET: the client must not silently lose the archive behind
//     recoverable download/live errors. On a no-fault run zero are tolerated;
//     the swarm faults target the upstream relay->jetstream path, not the
//     client->jetstream path, so the client should see none even under swarm.
