// Package subscribe owns the websocket fan-out behind the public
// /subscribe (legacy v1) and /xrpc/network.bsky.jetstream.subscribeEvents
// (v2, atproto proposal 0015) endpoints: the shared pull loop and
// cursor replay, plus each endpoint's wire framing, filtering dialect,
// and error contract.
//
// # Pull-based fan-out
//
// Every subscriber — live or cursor-resuming — runs the same pull loop:
// it calls Tail.ReadFrom(cursor) in a loop and is served wherever its
// cursor points. There is no per-subscriber outbound queue and no
// push broadcaster (the old model, which dropped clients once a bounded
// channel overflowed during a #sync-triggered burst). Backpressure is
// implicit: a client that reads slowly simply advances its cursor
// slowly. Nothing buffers on its behalf, so a slow reader cannot grow
// unbounded server memory.
//
// ReadFrom resolves a cursor against two tiers:
//
//   - The writer readable log: a byte-bounded, seq-indexed FIFO owned by the
//     ingest writer. It exposes recently appended events to subscribers
//     immediately and shares encode-once memoization via Entry (entry.go).
//     Caught-up live readers park here and wake on the next writer append.
//
//   - The cold reader (replay.go): when a cursor falls below the readable
//     log's resident base (evicted to disk) or replays older history, the
//     read falls through to a bounded disk walk over sealed segments +
//     the active segment's flushed region, routed through a shared byte-bounded decoded-
//     block LRU cache (blockcache.go) so concurrent cold readers don't
//     each re-decode the same block. The cache also carries one shared
//     Entry per cached event (#295), so cold subscribers reuse each
//     other's memoized JSON encodes and compressed frames the way hot
//     ones do; the entries charge their lazily-memoized bodies back to
//     the cache's byte budget as they materialize. zstd compression
//     itself runs on a bounded free list of encoders (encoderpool.go)
//     rather than one process-wide serialized encoder.
//
// Tail (tail.go) owns the readable-log adapter, the cold reader, and the graceful-close
// connection registry. The hot/cold boundary is transparent to ReadFrom
// callers. An adversarially-slow client — far behind the tip AND scanning
// the log below a floor rate for a sustained window — is dropped by the
// detector (slowdetect.go); a client that is merely behind but keeping
// pace, or behind a selective filter, is never dropped.
//
// Other concerns, each in its own file:
//
//   - encoder.go: pure function families that turn a segment.Event into
//     each endpoint's wire format — Encode (v1-compatible bare JSON
//     objects) and EncodeV2 (proposal-0015 xrpc.v1.json message frames
//     built through the lexgen-generated union, plus EncodeV2Error /
//     EncodeV2Info for the error and advisory frames).
//
//   - cursor.go: resolves the ?cursor= query parameter (seq or unix-µs
//     timestamp) against the manifest, clamped to the configured
//     lookback floor.
//
//   - filter.go: the v1 per-connection Filter — wantedCollections,
//     wantedDids, maxMessageSizeBytes — plus parsers for the
//     query-string and options_update wire formats. Frozen with the v1
//     wire.
//
//   - filterv2.go: the v2 FilterV2 — the three orthogonal AND-composed
//     axes (kinds, dids, collections) from the
//     network.bsky.jetstream.subscribeEvents lexicon, with crash-loud 400s
//     for unknown kinds, provably-inert combinations, and the legacy
//     wanted* parameter names.
//
//   - handler.go: an http.Handler that upgrades to a websocket, resolves
//     the cursor, and runs the pull loop, pumping filtered+encoded events
//     to the client. On v1 a reader goroutine accepts
//     SubscriberSourcedMessage frames and applies options_update by
//     swapping a per-connection atomic.Pointer[Filter]; on v2 the read
//     side is CloseRead — server-push only, any client data frame closes
//     the connection.
//
// V1 wire compatibility is the explicit design point. Where v2's house
// style ("crash loud, no silent fallbacks" — CLAUDE.md) would diverge
// from the v1 README's stated contract, this package deliberately
// matches v1. The places we do that are:
//
//   - On v1 only, maxMessageSizeBytes silently coerces
//     empty/malformed/negative values to 0 ("no cap"). v2 rejects malformed
//     syntax and overflow. v1 behavior is locked down by
//     TestParseMaxMsgSize_V1Compat.
//
//   - Identity and Account events bypass wantedCollections — they are
//     always delivered, regardless of the subscriber's collection
//     filter. v1 README: "Regardless of desired collections, all
//     subscribers receive Account and Identity events." Locked down by
//     TestWants_IdentityBypassesCollectionFilter.
//
//   - #sync events are deliberately not emitted on the v1 /subscribe wire —
//     v1 didn't emit them either (encoder.go Encode → errSkipEvent). The
//     v2 wire DOES emit #sync (EncodeV2), which is what the bundled Go
//     client consumes. #account and #identity are emitted on both wires.
//
//   - Unknown SubscriberSourcedMessage.Type values are logged and
//     ignored, not fatal. v1 has the same policy. Locked down by
//     TestHandler_OptionsUpdate_UnknownTypeIgnored.
//
//   - wantedCollections accepts any "<prefix>.*" pattern with no
//     validation of the head — v1's docs claim the head must pass
//     NSID validation, but v1's actual code does not enforce it,
//     and patterns like "app.bsky.*" appear in v1 client examples.
//     Locked down by TestParseQuery_PrefixCollection_TwoSegment.
//
//   - Filter caps fire post-dedupe (parseWantedDIDs and
//     parseWantedCollections build the unique set first, then
//     compare to MaxWantedDIDs / MaxWantedCollections). v1 does
//     the same on DIDs; we extend the same forgiveness to
//     collections for symmetry.
//
//   - A commit with an empty collection field bypasses the
//     wantedCollections filter — matches v1's WantsCollection.
//
//   - ?requireHello=true blocks event delivery until the client sends a
//     valid options_update over the websocket. Matches v1 README:
//     "a client can connect with ?requireHello=true ... to pause
//     replay/live-tail until the first Options Update message is
//     sent by the client over the socket." Locked down by
//     TestHandler_RequireHello_BlocksUntilOptionsUpdate. Invalid
//     updates during the wait disconnect the client; locked down by
//     TestHandler_RequireHello_InvalidUpdateDisconnects. Implementation
//     note: the pull loop only starts after the hello arrives, so the
//     first event a hello-mode client sees is one read from its start
//     cursor after the hello — there is no pre-hello buffering.
//
// # The v2 endpoint (proposal 0015)
//
// /xrpc/network.bsky.jetstream.subscribeEvents serves the wire contract
// declared in lexicons/network/bsky/jetstream/subscribeEvents.json:
//
//   - xrpc.v1.json framing — one self-describing JSON object per text
//     frame ({"$type":"message","payload":{...}} with the full
//     "<nsid>#<kind>" $type on the payload, or {"$type":"error",...}
//     terminal error frames). xrpc.v1.json is both the only supported
//     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol token and the lexicon default, so
//     negotiation is a header echo and every connection gets identical
//     framing.
//   - Server-push only: any client data frame closes the connection
//     (StatusPolicyViolation). No options_update, no requireHello.
//   - Three orthogonal AND-composed filter axes — kinds, dids,
//     collections (filterv2.go) — each match-all when unset.
//     collections constrains only commit events; use kinds to exclude
//     other kinds. Legacy wanted* params are named 400s.
//   - Pre-upgrade errors are XRPC JSON envelopes with structured names
//     (InvalidRequest, CursorTooOld, UnknownZstdDictionary,
//     ServiceUnavailable); clients match names, not body text.
//
// # Cursor replay and compression
//
// ?cursor= replay IS supported (cursor.go + the cold reader), resolving a
// seq or unix-µs timestamp cursor against the manifest, clamped to the
// configured --cursor-lookback floor. The too-old-cursor policy is
// endpoint-specific (Subscription.V2):
//
//   - /subscribe (v1): a seq cursor below the floor is silently CLAMPED up
//     to the floor (legacy v1 wire parity), made observable via the
//     "clamped" cursorRequests metric label.
//   - v2: a seq cursor below the floor is REJECTED with a pre-upgrade
//     HTTP 400 CursorTooOld carrying the floor seq, so a backfilling
//     client detects a slow handoff and re-backfills from its last seq
//     instead of silently skipping (requestedSeq, floor].
//   - The timestamp cursor path always clamps under BOTH endpoints: a
//     legacy timestamp cursor's documented contract is to start at the
//     oldest retained event, and the v2 reject policy governs only the
//     seq path. On v2 the clamp is announced: the first frame is an
//     #info OutdatedCursor naming the seq actually resumed from.
//
// Setting --cursor-lookback=0 disables replay: a cursor param is then
// accepted but resolves to the live tip rather than 400-ing, so v1 clients
// that always send a cursor still connect.
//
// Compression is endpoint-specific (#294; measured basis in
// specs/notes/2026-07-09-subscribe-compression-cpu-analysis.md):
//
// /subscribe (v1, wire-frozen) offers two schemes, at most one per client:
//
//   - RFC 7692 permessage-deflate, negotiated transparently when the
//     client offers it via Sec-WebSocket-Extensions (handler.go). Kept
//     solely for v1 wire parity: per-connection deflate is the dominant
//     server CPU cost at fanout scale (~2.3x the shared-zstd path at 200
//     subscribers, scaling linearly with subscriber count).
//
//   - The v1 custom-zstd-dictionary scheme (?compress=true or
//     Socket-Encoding: zstd). Opted-in connections receive binary
//     websocket frames, each a zstd frame compressed with the v1
//     custom dictionary (dict ID 1612007021, embedded in compress.go). A
//     client decodes with zstd.NewReader(nil, WithDecoderDicts(dict)).
//
//   - Offering BOTH at once is rejected with a 400: the two would
//     double-compress, so the client must pick one.
//
// The v2 endpoint serves uncompressed text frames by default and offers
// exactly ONE compression scheme, chosen deliberately for server
// cheapness at high fanout (the compressed frame is memoized per event
// and shared by every subscriber — near-zero marginal compression cost):
//
//   - dict-zstd, opted into with ?zstdDictionary=<id>, where <id> is the
//     zstd dictionary ID of the v2 dictionary (zstd_dictionary_v2,
//     retrained via `just train-subscribe-dict`) the client downloaded
//     through the getZstdDictionary XRPC endpoint. An unknown or retired
//     ID is a pre-upgrade 400 carrying the current ID — the server never
//     sends frames a client can't decode. A compressed connection carries
//     binary frames, each one zstd frame whose decompressed bytes are
//     exactly the xrpc.v1.json text frame (message, info, and error
//     frames alike). The legacy v1 opt-ins are 400s on v2, and
//     permessage-deflate is NEVER negotiated (a deflate offer silently
//     falls back to uncompressed per RFC 7692). This is a deliberate "no
//     zero-setup compression on v2" decision: v2's audience is thick
//     clients; browsers consume uncompressed frames or bring a wasm zstd
//     decoder.
//
// The maxMessageSizeBytes cap is enforced on the whole uncompressed frame
// (envelope included on v2) for all clients on both endpoints.
