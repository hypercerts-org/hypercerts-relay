package orchestrator

// import_pass.go wires the timestamp-import pipeline (design §8, milestones
// M4/M5) into the orchestrator so it shares the segment-rewrite lock and the
// manifest-refresh path with delete-compaction (design §3.3, §6 H).
//
// Phases (design §3.2):
//   - A+B (parse + bucket): stream the plain import CSV, validate each row, and
//     append its byte offset to the per-segment offset file its DID's blooms
//     select. Reads the manifest and writes offset files only -- it touches no
//     segment, so it runs OUTSIDE the rewrite lock.
//   - C (apply): for each segment with an offset file, build the per-path patch
//     plan and run one segment.Patch, in a worker pool, UNDER the rewrite lock
//     (mutually exclusive with delete-compaction; the loser waits).
//
// The whole operation is idempotent and re-runnable (design §3.4): a re-run
// produces zero mutations on already-applied segments, so segment.Patch skips
// the rename. That is the crash-resume backstop -- a job interrupted in Phase C
// resumes by re-running rather than restarting.
