// TestCompaction_StoreFaultOnWatermarkSave_FailsLoudNoAdvance is the kill for
// mutation m028 (compaction_watermark_save_error_swallowed), a new
// swallowed-persistence-error mutant on the compaction watermark write — a
// distinct high-risk fault point named in issue #30, and a different store op
// from m006 (a plain Set on compaction/seq, not a batch commit), so it
// exercises the fault seam's Set path.
//
// m028 inverts the error check on saveCompactionWatermark in
// runDeleteCompaction so a FAILED watermark write is swallowed and the pass
// proceeds: the in-memory watermark gauge and finalWatermark advance, tombstone
// eviction runs, and the pass returns success — all while the DURABLE
// compaction/seq is stale. On the next process the persisted watermark is below
// what was already rewritten, so a resumed compaction can re-drop or mis-handle
// rows relative to a watermark the rest of the system believed had advanced.
//
// We force the watermark Set to fail and assert the phase contract (#30): the
// pass fails LOUD and the durable watermark does NOT advance, so a restart
// re-runs the pass from the true persisted point. Under the mutant the error is
// swallowed and runDeleteCompaction returns nil — the kill.
