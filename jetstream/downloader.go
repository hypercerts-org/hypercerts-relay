// Download fetches and decodes every entry in plan order, invoking emit once per

//
//  1. a single PREFETCHER fetches whole-segment files a little ahead (bounded),
//     overlapping the next segment's download with the current one's decode,
//     while a BLOCK-FETCH COORDINATOR runs block-mode getBlock round trips on
//     its own parallel pool across blocks and entries (#292);
//  2. a POOL of d.concurrency DECODE workers decompresses + CBOR-decodes block
//     frames in parallel — the CPU-heavy work, fanned out across cores;
//  3. a single REASSEMBLER emits decoded blocks in global-seq order, so output
//     order is independent of which worker finished first.
//
// Parallel decode is the throughput lever (#142): a likes backfill is decode-
// bound, and serial decode pinned it to ~1 core. d.concurrency now sizes the
// decode pool — the parallelism knob.
//
// If emit returns false, Download stops early: it cancels in-flight and pending
// work and returns nil (a clean stop, not an error). It returns the first
// context error encountered; per-block download/decode failures are reported
// through entryResult.Err in order (not returned), so one bad block does not
// abort the backfill — the good prefix of that entry's blocks is emitted, then
// the error, then the entry stops and the next entry continues.
//
// Ordering invariant: the framer assigns a dense, monotonically increasing seq
// while walking entries in plan order and blocks in ascending index, and the
// reassembler emits strictly in that seq order; rows within a block keep their
// stored order. Per the segment format this yields per-DID ingestion order
// (docs/README.md §2 invariant #2, §3.1.1), the contract the client rests on.
// Parallel decode only reorders completion, never emission.
//
// Memory bound: at most inFlightWindow(d.concurrency) block frames are live
// between dispatch and emission (a global semaphore the reassembler drains in
// order), so decoded events held at once are O(window × block-size), not
// O(archive). Compressed whole-segment buffers are bounded to ~prefetchDepth
// resident files (a separate, larger term tracked by #143), independent of plan

// joined recoverable error alongside any valid decoded rows; one bad upstream
// record must not make the client lose the rest of the block.
//
// Commit rows dominate the archive (e.g. app.bsky.feed.like), and each commit's
// *Commit was one heap allocation. To cut that, the surviving commit rows of a
// block draw their Commit structs from a single per-block []Commit slab and the
// events reference &slab[i] — collapsing N allocations to one per block. The
// slab is sized exactly to the kept-commit count and NEVER appended to, so the
// &slab[i] pointers stay valid (a realloc would dangle them). It is a fresh
// allocation per block, dropped to GC with the batch; it is never pooled/reused,
// so a consumer still holding an earlier batch can never observe a mutation.
