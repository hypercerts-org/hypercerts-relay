	// surface a downstream chain break on the next event for that DID —
	// the previous rev's data hash no longer matches the new event's
	// prev_data because the linking event was dropped. The verifier's
	// PolicyResync recovers asynchronously, but it logs a "verification
	// failure" for visibility. That's not a regression in jetstream;
	// it's atmos doing exactly what it's designed to do under upstream
	// loss. We tune the simulator above to avoid drops, but under heavy
	// CI contention they can still happen, so we relax the chain-break
	// sentinel iff a drop preceded it. The unknown-event sentinel stays
	// strict — no upstream condition causes it.
	//
	// The drop signal is jetstream's own log message, NOT atmos's raw
	// DropError text ("event dropped: ..."): the live consumer catches
	// the *streaming.DropError and re-logs it under its own message with
	// structured fields (see internal/ingest/live/consumer.go's
	// "verify queue overflow dropped event"). atmos's string never
	// reaches this buffer. Keying off the structured slog `msg` field
