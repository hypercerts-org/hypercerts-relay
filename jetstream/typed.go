// TypedEvent pairs a delivered Event with its record decoded into the caller's
// type T. It is produced by TypedEvents.
//
//   - For a create/update commit whose Collection matches the requested NSID and
//     whose record decoded cleanly, Record is non-nil and DecodeErr is nil.
//   - For a commit whose record failed to decode into T, Record is nil and
//     DecodeErr is set (the Event is still delivered; nothing is dropped).
//   - For a delete, a non-commit event (identity/account/sync), or a commit of a
//     different collection, Record and DecodeErr are both nil — inspect Event.
//
// Event always carries the full envelope (DID/Seq/TimeUS/Kind and, for commits,
// Operation/Collection/Rkey/Rev/CID/RecordCBOR). In the raw-record modes that
// TypedEvents requires, Event.Commit.Record (the generic map) is nil by design.

// TypedEvents adapts a Client's event stream into records decoded as type T.
// During archive replay it avoids the generic map[string]any decode that dominates
// client CPU and allocations at scale (#142). The client MUST have been built
// with WithRawRecords or WithRawRecordsCopied so parallel archive workers pass
// segment CBOR straight to PT.UnmarshalCBOR. Live records are canonicalized from
// their atproto JSON representation before the same typed decode; live volume is
// low relative to archive replay, so that conversion is not the bottleneck.
//
// T is a lexicon record type and PT its pointer, constrained to implement
// UnmarshalCBOR — exactly the shape atmos's generated record types satisfy, so
// the call site is just:
//

//
// collection is the NSID whose commits are decoded into T; it MUST be non-empty
// and MUST match the type T. Only create/update commits of that collection are
// decoded — every other event (deletes, other collections, identity/account/
// sync) passes through with a nil Record (see TypedEvent). Requiring the
// collection is a safety measure: feeding one record type's bytes to another's
// UnmarshalCBOR can silently produce a garbage struct rather than an error, so
// TypedEvents never guesses. Pair it with WithCollections([]string{collection})
// on the Client so the server/engine only deliver that collection.
//
// Errors from the underlying stream are forwarded verbatim (with a nil batch),
// preserving the ErrFatal contract. Per-record decode failures are surfaced as
// TypedEvent.DecodeErr, not as stream errors, so one bad record does not abort
// iteration.
//
// Aliasing/lifetime: with WithRawRecords (the zero-copy default), a decoded *T
// may alias the client's internal buffer through Event.Commit.RecordCBOR — its
// string/byte fields are valid only for the current loop iteration. Copy what
// you need to retain, or build the Client with WithRawRecordsCopied for records
// that are safe to keep.
