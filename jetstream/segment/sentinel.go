// Reserved sentinel collection names for DID-level marker events.
//
// DID-level markers (#account, #identity, #sync) carry an empty
// Collection on the wire (see Event), so they are never indexed under a
// real NSID. A collection-filtered backfill selects blocks by
// collection, so without help it would never select the blocks that
// hold these markers — and because the live tail starts above the
// sealed tip, a collection-filtered consumer would never learn that an
// account was deleted and would keep its records forever.
//
// To make those blocks selectable without a side channel, the seal and
// rewrite index paths add a reserved sentinel collection name to a
// block's collection set for each DID-level marker kind the block
// contains. The planner admits these sentinels for every kind not explicitly
// excluded by a collection-filtered query (see
// manifest.collectionCandidatesForSegment), so the marker-safe default selects them
// while kinds=commit does not; the per-block DID bloom
// still narrows the selection by DID. The markers then ride inline
// through the normal segment/block download and a folding consumer
// converges — the same path record-level deletes already take.
//
// The names begin with '$', which makes them invalid NSIDs: atmos.ParseNSID
// requires at least three dot-separated segments. A client's requested
// collections are always validated as exact NSIDs or NSID-authority
// wildcard prefixes, so a request can neither name nor prefix-match a
// sentinel — they can never collide with real collection traffic. This
// invariant is locked by TestSentinelCollectionsAreInvalidNSIDs; if a
// future NSID grammar ever accepted a '$'-leading label, that test fails
// loudly rather than silently opening a collision.
//
// These strings are written into sealed segment footers' collection
// string tables and are therefore part of the on-disk format: once a
// segment is sealed with a sentinel, the value is load-bearing and must
// not be renamed without re-sealing every affected segment.
